This is because a longer claim has more details – and all those details must be met for another invention to be infringing. Hence, the more details there are in the patent, the greater are the opportunities for others to invent around it. We validate our measure by showing both that patent attorneys’ subjective assessments of scope agree with our estimates, and that the behavior of patenters is consistent with it. To facilitate drawing causal inferences with our measure, we show how it can be used to create an instrumental variable, patent examiner Scope Toughness, which we also validate.","Examiners, patent scope, legal, assessment",,,scope estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-run dynamics of the US patent classification system,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZJCDCE,"The dataset contains several files used in the paper ""Long-run dynamics of the US patent classification system"" by François Lafond and Daniel Kim. The files contain data on the evolution of the number of classes in the United States Patent Classification System between 1836 and 2015, data on the original (at grant date) and current (2015) primary classification at the class level of patents granted between 1976 and 2015, and related supporting files.","patents, classification systems, reclassification",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BIGPATENT,https://huggingface.co/datasets/big_patent,"BIGPATENT, consisting of 1.3 million records of U.S. patent documents along with human written abstractive summaries. Each US patent application is filed under a Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) code.

Compared to existing summarization datasets, BIGPATENT has the following properties: i) summaries contain a richer discourse structure with more recurring entities, ii) salient content is evenly distributed in the input, and iii) lesser and shorter extractive fragments are present in the summaries. Finally, we train and evaluate baselines and popular learning models on BIGPATENT to shed light on new challenges and motivate future directions for summarization research.","patents, summarization, classification, validation",yes,"summarisation, classification",patent classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FinBERT,https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert,"FinBERT is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze sentiment of financial text. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification. Financial PhraseBank by Malo et al. (2014) is used for fine-tuning.","financial, sentiment, validation",yes,sentiment analysis,financial market analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset,https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/economic-research/research-datasets/artificial-intelligence-patent-dataset,"The Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset consists of two files, both released by the OCE. The first data file identifies United States (U.S.) patents issued between 1976 and 2020 and pre-grant publications (PGPubs) published through 2020 that contain one or more of several AI technology components (including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech, knowledge processing, AI hardware, evolutionary computation, and planning and control). 

OCE generated this data file using a machine learning (ML) approach that analyzed patent text and citations to identify AI in U.S. patent documents. The second data file contains the patent documents used to train the ML models.","AI, validation, patents",yes,semantic analysis,patent classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CLEF-IP,http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~clef-ip/index.html,"CLEF was a long-running project to benchmark cross-language information retrieval (IR) models. CLEF-IP was a strand of this benchmarking research that ran from 2010-2013, the data from which was used as a benchmarking activity of the CLEF 2010-2013 conferences.

The CLEF-IP collection contains patents, physically stored as a collection of XML fields encoding patent documents. A patent document may be an application document, a search report, or a granted patent document. 

All textual documents in the CLEF-IP collection contain the following main XML fields: bibliographic data, abstract, description, and claims. Not all documents actually have content in these _x001c_elds. 

The datasets are archived on the CLEF-IP site, and in the TU Wien research data repository (with DOIs) here: https://researchdata.tuwien.at/search?q=clef-ip&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=bestmatch","validation, information retrieval, patents, semantic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Women in the Copyright System,https://www.copyright.gov/policy/women-in-copyright-system/,"Coverage: The data set contains copyright registration records, copyright renewal records, and recorded document records, from January 1, 1978, to July 8, 2021.

Content: The data set contains information on authors, types of works registered, publication status, and other relevant copyright information. More detailed descriptions of the fields, variables, and definitions can be found in the Library of Congress Copyright Data as Distributed in the Marc Format document available here.

The data are available in twenty-six file parts, numbered sequentially, and include recorded document and registration records. Registration and recorded document records for any variable or year may be present in multiple file parts. Individual file parts may not contain all available records pertaining to any specific variable and may not be suitable for analysis independent of the full data set.","copyright, gender, united states",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
World Management Survey,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OY6CBK,"The World Management Survey is the first cross-country, cross-industry dataset built to measure the quality of management practices in establishments. The WMS is an interview-based evaluation tool that defines 18 key management practices, and scores them from 1 (“worst practice”) to 5 (“best practice”). The evaluation focuses on three key areas: First, monitoring: How well do organizations monitor what goes on inside the firm, and then use this information for continuous improvement? Second, targets: Do organizations set the right targets, track the right outcomes, and take appropriate action if the two are inconsistent? Third, incentives/people management: Are organizations promoting and rewarding employees based on performance, prioritizing careful hiring, and trying to keep their best employees?

Measuring the Position and Differentiation of Firms in Technology Space,https://zenodo.org/record/5172146,"Although the rate of invention by firms and the effect on firm performance have been central themes in economics and strategy, the position and differentiation of invention by firms have received less attention. We develop a method to characterize a firm’s technology portfolio based on the semantic content of patents that allows us to map a firm’s unique spatial position relative to every other firm in technology space and to measure the overall differentiation of a firm’s technology portfolio. Using a large panel of U.S. public firms from 1980 to 2015, we illustrate that technology differentiation has a strong positive correlation with firm performance, particularly in research and development-intensive industries and industries with strong product market rivalry. We also show that technology differentiation is associated with subsequent differentiation from competitors in the product market and a reduction in outgoing technology spillovers to other firms. We provide open access to code and data to characterize the technology portfolio of firms and to measure the technological position and differentiation of U.S. public firms.","differentiation, semantic analysis, competition",yes,semantic analysis,scope estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 16:18:23 GMT"
